Hi Denis,

The data is available here:

I don't group files according to features tested, but I hope the naming scheme is of some help. In the future I will make sure to specifically reference all files in the test protocol.

Note that I have only provided expected output for files used in translation-related unit tests. For systems tests I check the output to see if it looks right. Because the system we currently use is far from perfect, the only way to produce actual high-quality reference files would be to write them by hand, which is far too time-consuming.

Yours sincerely,
Steffen
