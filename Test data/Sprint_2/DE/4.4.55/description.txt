Hi Bert,

Here is the test data including the css for the test 4.4-55. 
I corrected the source replacing
<brl:literal>???????</brl:literal> with <brl:literal>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;??????&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</brl:literal>. 
However, the output is the same: the whitespace collapses where it should be preserved.

Regards,
Mischa
