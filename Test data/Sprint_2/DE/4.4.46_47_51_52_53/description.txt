Hi Bert,

Please find enclosed the css-file for the tests 4.4-46.47.51.52.53.
By the way, I re-ran the tests and noticed that there are different results depending on the transform field:


1. (formatter:dotify)(translator:sbs)(grade:0)
--> no output, process is hanging eternally

2. field empty:
--> output as stated in my protocol:
4.4:46: Pass
4.4:47: Fail (no top/bottom border)
4.4:51: Pass
4.4:52: Fail (wrong indent)
4.4:53: Pass

3. (formatter:dotify):
--> output as follows:
4.4:46: Pass
4.4:47: Fail (braille signs in css are ignored)
4.4:51: Pass
4.4:52: Fail (wrong indent)
4.4:53: Fail (-obfl-vertical-position has no effect)

Thanks for clarifying the issue.

Regards,
Mischa
