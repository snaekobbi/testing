Oh, yes, the devil is in the details. Now it works nice!

The only thing I have left to comment, is that the toc should not include headers from frontmatter, but I guess that is a small CSS matter and don’t need to be tested further.

Hi Kari,
It seems your input XML is invalid. The line "<?xml... ?>" MUST be on the very first line of the file. You have an empty line before it :)

Hi Kari,

Could you try the following?

#generated-toc li {
  display: block;
  margin-left: 2;
  text-indent: -2;
}
#generated-toc li a::after {
  content: ' ' leader('?') ' ' target-counter(attr(href), page); }

Notice the "leader" that I added.

Due to a known bug the braille page numbers after the leaders will end up on the next line. But at least you'll see the leaders working already.

Not sure if I got the indentation right, but you can further tweak that. Note that "#generated-toc li" selects all toc entries, and the margins are accumulated, which means that level 1 entries of will get a margin of 2, level 2 entries get a margin of 4 (2 + 2), etc:

,KORSDRAGER SOVER I SOLNEDGANG
  EN MORGEN ................... #B
  ,OVERSKRIFT NIV* #B ......... #G
  ,OVERSKRIFT NIV* #C ......... #G
,ULVEN OG KALVEN ............. #DI
,[MFINTLIGHET ................ #GI

If for some reason you need to select level 1 entries and level 2 entries separately, use the CSS child selector:

/* level 1 */
#generated-toc > li {
  ...
}

/* level 2 */
#generated-toc > li > li {
  ...
}


Hope this helps,
Bert
