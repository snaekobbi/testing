Hi,

Sending some test material for tables, especially req. 4.4.57, I think (stairstep format). 

Note: 

•	Input: 
	o	Column headings have markup <th>

•	Output: 
	o	Markers in braille for empty cells. 
	o	Text in braille inserted to explain that column headings follow. 

•	I will try to make another example with a table that have markup <th> for row headings too. Such a table should be treated differently, I think.

Regards,
Björn
