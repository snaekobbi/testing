Hi Bert and Denis,

Here is two examples for the hyphenation test. The one named 4.3.41 contains some special words that are difficult to hyphen, e.g. busstopp (get an extra s when hyphenated buss-stopp).  The other example is a standard text.

Hyphenation is a challenge. I don’t expect us to be able to follow all the Norwegian hyphenation rules (some of them is mentioned in the DTBook). The PEF here is from NorBraille and I don’t exactly know how the rules in NorBraille works. But I have written the same word over and over again to show different possibilities to hyphen. 

Note that I will be away 4 weeks from Monday, so if you need me to look at some results, last day to do that for a while, is tomorrow.


Med vennlig hilsen
