Hi,
 
Filled out the report. 
Note that I added a few comments to requirements that were not assigned to NL. 
In particular, print page ranges do not work correctly (Bert suggests this is because of a change in Dotify from +/- December last year). 
This feature is very important to NL.
 
Thanks,
Davy
